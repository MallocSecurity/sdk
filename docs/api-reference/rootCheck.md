# 🪓 Root Check

The **Malloc Security SDK** offers a comprehensive root detection feature that checks for common indicators of a rooted device. This includes known rooting binaries, packages, superuser access, and modified security properties.

> ⚠️⚠️ This function is not yet available in version 0.1.X
---

## Option 1: Asynchronous Usage

####  Java
```java
MallocSDK.rootCheckAsync(new MallocSDK.ScanFinishedCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onScanFinished(JSONObject rootCheckResults) {
        // Use the rootCheckResults
    }
});
```

---

## Option 2: Synchronous Usage

> Do **not** call this on the main/UI thread.

####  Java
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
executor.execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        JSONObject rootCheckResults = MallocSDK.rootCheckSync();
        // Use the rootCheckResults
    }
});
executor.shutdown();
```

## Interpretation

* `rooted_flag`: A high-level boolean flag indicating if the device appears to be rooted.
* `root_check_results`: A list of all individual root checks performed, with their respective results and descriptions.
* `issue_found`: A boolean indicating whether the check flagged something (true = suspicious, false = clean)
* `check_description`: A short, readable explanation of what that check was about. Possible values:  
  - **Root Management Apps**: Checks against known root management applications.  
  - **Potentially Dangerous Apps**: Detects apps that typically require root privileges.  
  - **Root Cloaking Apps**: Identifies root-hiding apps and checks native library read access.  
  - **Test Keys**: Verifies kernel signing status (Release-Keys vs Test-Keys).  
  - **BusyBox Binary**: Scans common system locations for BusyBox.  
  - **SU Binary**: Checks common paths for Superuser binary.  
  - **2nd SU Binary Check**: Alternative check for Superuser binary.  
  - **RW Paths**: Verifies write permissions on protected system directories.  
  - **Dangerous Props**: Examines system properties for known risky configurations.  
  - **Root via Native Check**: Performs low-level root detection through native library checks.  
  - **Magisk Specific Checks**: Looks for Magisk framework components in common locations.  

The `status` field in the returned JSON indicates the result of the operation. Possible values include:
* `success` – The operation completed successfully and the result contains valid data.
* `failed_sdk_not_initialized` – The SDK was not initialized before the function was called. Ensure MallocSDK has been initialised.
* `failed_access_forbidden` – The operation was blocked, possibly due to missing permissions or restricted access.
* `failed_no_internet_connection` – The device has no active internet connection, which is required to perform the scan.
* `error` – A general error occurred during the operation (e.g., unexpected exception or parsing failure).

> These status strings are defined as final constants in the [MallocSdkResponseJson](./mallocSdkResponseJson.md) class.

## ✅ Best Practices

- Always perform root checks **after SDK initialization** is completed.
- Use the **asynchronous** version for better UI performance.
- Always check the status field before relying on other content within the JSON.
