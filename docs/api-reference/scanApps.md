# üì± App Scanning

The **Malloc Security SDK** includes a powerful App Scan feature to help detect potentially dangerous apps on the device. It performs:

* Spyware app detection
* Permission analysis (dangerous or privacy-invading permissions)
* Accessibility services usage detection
* **(New in 0.2.1+)** APK file hash scanning (see `scan_apps_sha` parameter below)

> The scan can include system apps and apps without internet access based on the provided flags.

---

## Execution Options

This operation is offered in three versions:

| Version                    | Callback Type                 | Notes                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `scanAppsPerAppAsync(...)` | `AppsScanningUpdatesCallback` | Provides granular scanning progress             |
| `scanAppsAsync(...)`       | `ScanFinishedCallback`        | Returns final result after all apps are scanned |
| `scanAppsPerScanSync(...)` | ‚Äî                             | Synchronous, must run off main thread           |

---

## Parameters

Both async and sync versions accept three boolean flags:

* `include_system_apps`: whether to include system applications.
* `include_apps_with_no_internet_access`: whether to include apps without internet access.
* `scan_apps_sha`: **(New in 0.2.1+)** if true, it also scans the APK file used to install each app to determine if it is malicious by analyzing its hash. **Requires an active internet connection.**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The `scan_apps_sha` option requires an active internet connection to analyze APK hashes for malware.

## Option 1: Per-App Async Scan (With Updates)

Provides progress updates while scanning apps.

### Java

```java
MallocSDK.AppsScanningUpdatesCallback appsScanningUpdatesCallback = new MallocSDK.AppsScanningUpdatesCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onAppsToScanListReady(List<ApplicationInfo> apps_to_scan) {
        // The apps_to_scan list contains a list of the ApplicationInfo of the apps to be scanned
    }

    @Override
    public void onScanningAppUpdate(ApplicationInfo now_scanning_app) {
        // The now_scanning_app is the app currently in scan
    }

    @Override
    public void onScanProgressUpdate(ApplicationInfo now_scanning_app, int total_scanned, int total_to_scan) {
        // The now_scanning_app is the app currently in scan
        // The total_scanned is the total number of the scanned apps
        // The total_to_scan is the total number of apps to scan
    }

    @Override
    public void onScanFinished(JSONObject result) {
        // use the result
    }
};

MallocSDK.scanAppsPerAppAsync(appsScanningUpdatesCallback, false, false, true);
```

## Option 2: Async Scan (Final Result Only)

### Java

```java
MallocSDK.scanAppsAsync(new MallocSDK.ScanFinishedCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onScanFinished(JSONObject result) {
        // use the result
    }
}, false, false, true);
```

---

## Option 3: Synchronous Scan

> Do **not** call on the main thread.

### Java

```java
executor.execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        JSONObject result = MallocSDK.scanAppsPerScanSync(false, false, true);
        // use the result
    }
});
```

## Interpretation

* `spyware_apps`: Identified packages flagged as known spyware.
* `app_permissions`: A breakdown of dangerous permissions granted per app.
* `packages_with_enabled_accessibility_services`: Apps using accessibility services, often abused by spyware or intrusive apps.
* `packages_with_malicious_apk`: Apps whose APK files were flagged as malicious based on hash analysis. Each entry includes details about the detection. This helps identify apps that may have been tampered with or are known malware, even if they appear legitimate on the device

The `status` field in the returned JSON indicates the result of the operation. Possible values include:
* `success` ‚Äì The operation completed successfully and the result contains valid data.
* `failed_sdk_not_initialized` ‚Äì The SDK was not initialized before the function was called. Ensure MallocSDK has been initialised.
* `failed_access_forbidden` ‚Äì The operation was blocked, possibly due to missing permissions or restricted access.
* `failed_no_internet_connection` ‚Äì The device has no active internet connection, which is required to perform the scan.
* `error` ‚Äì A general error occurred during the operation (e.g., unexpected exception or parsing failure).

> These status strings are defined as final constants in the [MallocSdkResponseJson](./mallocSdkResponseJson.md) class.

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

* Run this scan after SDK initialization.
* Prefer the async versions for better performance and smoother UI experience.
* Use `scanAppsPerAppAsync` if you want fine-grained progress feedback.
* Always check the status field before relying on other content within the JSON.
